But that's it. These aren't divisional rivals, the team's are on much different trajectories, and it's not like either of these teams are undefeated, desperate, etc.

I also get why the media is gaga over this. It means ratings, clicks, amd money.

But good God the amount of endless deepthroating if this game has been way more insufferable than the usual media bullshit. It's so out of proportion and overblown you'd think Brady has literally been resurrected from the dead, and walked in water from Tampa Bay to Boston Harbor for this game. And that Belichik was was torn as much as general tasked with winning the Western Front knowing his son was on the front lines for the other side.

I am glad this game is underway. It's just another fucking game, and can't wait until this is over so the media can go back to gagging themselves in something else (or at least rebalancing their ceaseless administration of shaft licking between Brady, Mahomes, and Rodgers). Fuck Brady AND the Patriots"

As much as I hate you, Oakland, and now Vegas, and probably mutually, what are all of your guys' thoughts coming into this game? 


If I'm completely honest, I didn't expect the Chargers to play as well as they have been this year so far. I'm so used to both of our teams looking alright and then bombing when it matters. 


Some takeaways from the season so far from my perspective: 


Yes, I'm a statistics head and a lot of my couch coaching involves weighing the numbers‚ÄîI personally think they mean a lot in '21. 


-- 1 // games so far + qb -- 

Carr is consistently looking better than he always has. Coaching is giving him an insane amount of pass attempts this year which is scary for us. Ravens and Steelers were games I would have both guessed y'all would lose closely. Ravens I would have been iffy on, maybe pull a win, but closed out both of those games solidly. Not the two easiest teams in the NFL. Dolphins aren't looking great this year so far, so I won't say much about that win.

Herbert looking like he isn't going to slump this year like most of analysts and fans thought. Staley, our new HC, is actually paying off already for us going for more and more ballsy attempts that keep the games close. 

-- 2 // penalities + discipline --

This season has been horrific for both our teams in terms of accepted penalities (not counting declined/offsetting penalities). 

Chargers are actually the worst in the league right now for yards against in terms of non declined/offsetting penalties with a ridiculous 243 yards against us.

team are still close though with a respectable 206 yards. 

This game is going to be penalty hell most likely regardless if it's been the officiating or actual team/player issues.

Let's talk about net penalties, this to me is a metric of how dirty a team plays (not considering bad officiating). Where 0 net penalties is the average, anything +5 is terrible, and anything -5 shows that the games played so far were against worse offenders in that regard. 

team Net: -5
Chargers Net: -4 

With that said, both teams seem to get penalized a lot less than their opponents which shows pretty good discipline. 

-- 3 // run offense + run defense --

This section includes rushing too by QB as well as pure RB, but not RB acting as a receiver. 

team: 91.3 yards
Chargers: 87.3 yards

We're both on the bottom of the league in terms of run offense, and both on the bottom of the league in terms of run attempts, which makes this statistic pretty comparable. This aligns well with the idea that coaching for both teams is pass heavy this year and that this game is going to be a shootout :)

-- 4 // points per game + turnovers -- 

Believe it or not, team are top 6 in NFL in terms of points per game with a blistering 30 point game average. While Chargers are near league bottom with a crushing 22.3 point game average. 

Although Chargers have played against teams who averaged 20 points per game, the net stat is what matters here and that comes out to +2.3 PPG on opponents. 

For the team, y'all have a +6.0 PPG on opponents which is a scary lead even though it may seem small. 

Chargers have a ~70% chance of turning over the ball in any fashion in a game in '21 one time. With a 30% chance of it being a fumble and a 40% chance of it being an INT. 

team have a ~30% chance of turning over the ball in any fashion in a game in '21 one time. With a 4% chance of it being a fumble and a 26% chance of it being an INT. 

Although both teams weigh towards INT as a turnover possibility, both teams have also shown that neither coaching nor the offending player has been phased by it. Which is a great thing and shows that the coaches are decent and the players are great. 

-- 5 // run defense --

This is the Achilles Heel of the Chargers right now who rank last in the league in run defense. 

Chargers have an average ridiculous number of 170 yards per game on the ground against them while team have an averave of 120 yards per game against them on the ground. 

Both of these numbers are horrific historically, but the Chargers moreso. 

It can be expected that both of our teams will run for over 100 yards this Monday, and it may actually decide the game. It'll definitely be my main focus in a pass heavy game. 




--- TLDR



Really excited for Monday's game, with my bias weighed against the statistics I'm going with Chargers by a PK. This, in terms of the odds and betting of sports games, is a coin flip with a 1% edge. 

The game to me will likely be decided by a last second point after attempt, long FG, or an unlikely offensive mishap (strong INT, crazy fumble, or a safety).

I am heavily biased towards 538, Nate Silver's statistics/prediction company. I believe he's very good at predicting the NFL and the games that come with. Surprisingly, he also has this game as a coin flip. 

It's going to be a super fun game and glad we got the primetime slot. Would love to hear from you guys and your input on it too. Primetime versus the team I hate most besides the Chiefs, what are y'all thinking about Monday?"

Hello team Nation! I was hoping you could help me with a dilemma. My GF who I love dearly has recently become infatuated with one *Derek Carr* and I desperately want to know how I can get that *Derek Carr Look.* I'm a 5 1/2 foot tall guy, about 275 lbs with striking features but I'm terrified if I don't quickly become an MVP caliber ""total Chad"" she might leave me for someone who fires the pigskin with more grace. You see, I've been in the gym and have lost 3 lbs in the last 8 weeks so getting into peak hundred-million-dollar pro athlete shape isn't the problem. I can easily attain a chiseled physique, that's not the issue.

It's my jaw line.

You see, no matter how much bubble gum I chew or audibles I make at the line I can't seem to pull off *Derek's* alpha profile. My chin and jaw mostly resembles a soggy pillow case full of tumble weeds and my trainer at Planet fitness nor my own mother have any answers how to improve it. So I've decided on V-Line Jaw surgery! Mandibulplasty for all you pre-meds.

My question is: If you had to describe Derek Carr's jawline as a sports car, what year, make and model would it be? And if anyone has anecdotal experience with the recovery time associated with shaving centimeters off your mandible, please let me know! A week without Chick-fil-A is a week I don't want to live AMMIRITE GUYS?! But seriously does that shit hurt?

Willing to maxx out my dad's American Express to make it happen.

7,pzjxnu,raiders,1633131694,1,20,6,259,"I‚Äôve been to three games now and have picked up a few tips and tricks along the way and thought I would share. Please feel free to add. 

-	If you‚Äôre going to stay at a casino, go early to the game. The stadium itself is worth walking around and enjoying. 
-	Closest hotels are Mandalay Bay, Delano (closest), and Luxor. Delano has no casino but connects to Mandalay Bay. 
-	If you‚Äôre going to more than one game, get a players card at the casino and use it every time you gamble or spend money at the casino/restaurants. Get those perks! This can get you comp rooms or discounted. 
-	Leaving Sunday night on a 1pm game is easily doable. 
-	more than two nights in Vegas is rough. 
-	You can check your luggage at any hotel. Feel free to bring bags to Mandalay and check them before the game. It‚Äôs about a 20 minute wait to get bags
-	Getting a cab to the airport Sunday after the game is difficult. The line is LONG. Be prepared to use Uber/Lyft if you‚Äôre in a hurry. Black cars will come faster. 
-	Do scream raaaaiiiiderrrrrsss everywhere you go. 
-	I like to get a few sports bets in and try to make it a free trip. 3 for 3 so far! Best advice for visiting team fans"

12,pzj3t4,raiders,1633128826,1,12,5,176,"I just traded for Ruggs in a fantasy football league. Gave up Allen Robinson but netted picks to flip for Davante Adams. It helps that I have Carr in my league (Superflex Dynasty) 

But this isn‚Äôt about that. This is about what you team fans think of Ruggs. 

I‚Äôve seen what he‚Äôs doing so far which is why I pulled the trigger on him. Great deep ball catcher. Can make guys miss when needed. Absolute burner speed and solid hands overall. 

But seriously where do you guys believe he ranks in the WCO passing attack? I‚Äôd say 2 behind Waller but some people are leading me to believe Renfrow is gonna emerge as the overall better player. 

TLDR: How does team Nation feel about Ruggs for this seasons outlook and beyond? My main concern is targets but I really believe Carr will start upping his target share as the season goes on. What to expect from Ruggs"

we are team fans. we dont give a shit about any of it. fuck them all. why is this sub so obsessed with what the media or ‚Äúexperts‚Äù think about our team."
33,pzadqa,raiders,1633102161,1,19,14,492,"  

Welcome, everyone! In this thread r/chargers will **ask questions or have civil trash talk about the team**, and it will be up to our sub to give them really informative answers! **If you're interested in asking questions/civil trash talk about the Chargers, follow the link at the bottom of this post. Try to keep this to team-related questions only.**

This is a fun chance for fans to get to know more about both teams from a bit of an inside perspective, and over the past couple seasons, I feel like this has been one of the stronger ways of intelligently discussing important match-ups that otherwise get overlooked. I don't want to tie you guys and gals down with too many rules, but here are a few that have proven to keep these threads unified and on target:

¬∑ **Don't be a dick or get personal with trash talk**. We're guests on each other's subs, and while the flare-ups typically don't happen as much outside of the AFC West division games, I just feel obligated to put this in.

¬∑ **Don't ask extremely-obvious questions**, like ""Is \_\_\_ going to play?"". Most of the time, we don't have any more information than you would, and the point of this to get really in-depth and focus on specific players. Note that ""With \_\_\_ out, how has your depth at that position been this season?"" is an acceptable question, though, since it actually addresses something deeper than a yes or no question :)

¬∑ **DO feel free to share breakdowns or articles pertaining to your team that may be relevant**! Most of the time, fans of one team's sub rarely cross over into another, so news that may be buzzing from all of your beat reporters or that sweet GIF breakdown of a couple of players from last game may not be as reported elsewhere.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: To all commenters, I have been doing this with each team every week and haven‚Äôt had any serious problems (that I know of). I know it‚Äôs a division game on primetime, so the tension and stakes are high! Therefore, BE CIVIL! DON‚ÄôT GO PERSONALLY WITH THE TRASH TALK (slurs, doxxing, DM-ing, etc.). If you get banned or comment gets modded cause of the hosting sub-reddit violations, that is on you! No one else! If all goes well, I will do this again for the second matchup Week 4 MNF LAC vs LVR Q&amp;A/CIVIL TRASH TALK THREAD"

Consider the fact that ""experts"" are still trotting out nonsense like ""I don't like the roster moves Gruden and Mayock have made/They haven't done well in the draft"" and then you'll understand why they shouldn't be taken seriously

Without looking it up, I'd blindly bet no team in the league has as many home grown late round picks, UDFA, and practice squad steals starting, and contributing, as the team do.  If I'm right, the logical conclusion is nobody has done a better job the last three years putting together a team than Mayock and Gruden.  I'll take it a step further and ask if anyone can think of a team all-time that had a dearth of talent equal to the 2018 team, and turned it into this level of talent four years later.

I come in peace as a Vikings fan. 

So my girlfriend has been watching me watch football and she has no jerseys. She has been slowly getting into it and she has landed on the team as her team. At first it's because she said they have the cutest jerseys but now she is actually following them religiously!

I saw a jersey that she would love but I can't seem to find it and every website I go to seems to lead nowhere. It's a Tanner Muse jersey with gold accents. She saw it and thought it was awesome and I want to surprise her with it for her birthday. 

Can anyone help me find it? I know he's on the practice squad so it will be hard to find but I always call her my ""muse"" so I think it's super fitting. Can someone help me find a jersey?"

I will include an excerpt, but not the story since I think The Athletic is a great site and worth the $1 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The ‚ÄúCarrdiac Kids‚Äù are at their best when the game is on the line, and the second-year players are a big reason the team are 3-0 for the first time in 19 years. Edwards [leads the NFL](https://twitter.com/Jimmy_Durkin/status/1442372866293387271) with 163 receiving yards (on seven catches) in the fourth quarter or overtime of games this season (The team also beat the [Ravens](https://theathletic.com/team/ravens/) in overtime.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Ruggs is second with 130 yards on five catches.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun being their teammates and watching them develop because they took a lot of criticism from a lot of people last year,‚Äù Renfrow said.

If you have a sub to the site, check it out. If you don't, consider I because there are a lot of good stories about the team this year.

33,pxj5lt,raiders,1632873246,1,23,5,571,"Henry Ruggs is finally getting some respect, but there is still a lot of doubt about him and people are obsessed with saying that we made a mistake by drafting him.

When we drafted him, the explicit purpose was to get our version of Tyreek Hill, which of course makes perfect sense in this division. Drafting CeeDee Lamb genuinely would not have made sense from a roster construction standpoint, which of course no one pays attention to. It's always just a straight comparison of production. CeeDee is a stud, but he's a possession YAC receiver. If you think about how we throw the ball by distance, 90% of the time throwing inside of 10 yards is going to be Waller, Renfrow, and running backs out of the backfield who both Gruden and Carr love to dump off too. Adding another guy to that mix would have been redundant. CeeDee would put up numbers here I'm sure, but they would have taken away from Waller and Renfrow, which doesn't make sense considering CeeDee is not reliable as Waller and Renfrow is just as shifty (plus Lamb drops a lot of passes)

The purpose of drafting Ruggs was to 1) take the top off the defense for long chunk plays and touchdowns and 2) have a gravity that pulls safeties away from everybody else. People who actually watch team film have consistently noted that he's had the gravity since day one. Obviously, the production wasn't where we wanted it to be in terms of yards and TD's.

But here's the thing. If we drafted Ruggs to be our Tyreek, he is right on schedule. Tyreek's rookie year he had 593 yards on 9.7 YPC, whereas Ruggs had 452 on 17.4 YPC. I fully believe that if you gave Ruggs a full training camp and pre-season in year 1, he puts up the same numbers as Hill. Maybe a touchdown less.

Point is, we are now seeing the fruit born as Ruggs is comfortable with the offense. He's becoming the Tyreek Hill threat that we drafted him for, especially as defenses treat Waller differently. Waller is now seen as not just a guy that's going to have big games, but a guy that can straight up get you beat if you don't scheme for him like Kelce. 

Gruden and Mayock have made plenty of mistakes, and they deserve legit criticism for Arnette (who I think just flat out sucks) and Cle (who I still have hope for as a run stopper). But they have constructed this offense in a way that is as dangerous as any in the league. If Bryan Edwards fully develops into the mid-range guy that can excel as on jump balls and contested catches, there's nothing that we cannot do offensively. And Ruggs has been a huge part of that from day one, even if he wasn't putting up the numbers. He's doing exactly what we drafted him for, but now it's starting to show up in the box score. Tyreek Hill vs Henry Ruggs"

44,pxfurz,raiders,1632862968,1,20,9,390,"""The Autumn Wind"" was written by former NFL Films President and co-founder Steve Sabol. Narrated by John Facenda. Produced in 1974. Mary Jane **Carr** was an American author and poet. Her poem ""Pirate Wind"" was adapted as The Autumn Wind by NFL Films founder Steve Sabol for the team's official team yearbook film in 1974, of the same title, and also for NFL Films' hour-long recap of the 1974 season. Legend has it that when team owner and managing general partner Al Davis heard ""The Autumn Wind"" song for the first time, he remained silent for a second before telling then NFL Films President Ed Sabol that he loved it, and that ""it epitomized everything that the team stood for"".

The original ""Pirate Wind"" poem is reproduced below.

The autumn wind‚Äôs a pirate
Blustering in from the sea;
With a rollicking song, he sweeps along
Swaggering boisterously.

His skin is weather-beaten;
He wears a yellow seash
With a handkerchief red about his head
And a bristling black mustache.

He laughs as he storms the country,
A laugh that‚Äôs loud and bold;
And all the trees quake and shiver and shake,
As he robs them of their gold.

The autumn wind‚Äôs a pirate,
Pillaging‚Äôs just for fun!
He‚Äôll snatch your hat as quick as that
And laugh to see you run! 

And finally ""The Autumn Wind""

""The Autumn Wind is a pirate.
Blustering in from sea,
With a rollicking song, he sweeps along,
Swaggering boisterously.
His face is weather beaten.
He wears a hooded sash,
With a silver hat about his head,
And a bristling black mustache.

He growls as he storms the country,
A villain big and bold.
And the trees all shake and quiver and quake,
As he robs them of their gold.

The Autumn Wind is a team,
Pillaging just for fun.
He'll knock you 'round and upside down,
And laugh when he's conquered and won."" An Interesting Tidbit about ""The Autumn Wind"""

We can and will get better throughout the season and it‚Äôs a really good feeling knowing our team still has plenty of upside. 

Our offensive line has to improve down the stretch so we can run the ball and keep the defenses honest. I like that Carr is throwing a lot but it doesn‚Äôt seem sustainable. Once we can run the ball effectively, our offense will open up more and stay on the field to give our defense more time to rest. 

Our defense has been as advertised, I wanna see some plays being made more often like Hayward‚Äôs safety! It really got us going with a momentum shift! If our defense creates more turnovers and shorter fields we will be able to extend leads and not be so conservative in the 2nd half.

""Avoid catastrophic mistakes."" Is something he's said quite a few times these past few weeks.

[""Snap accuracy wasn't good enough yesterday""](https://youtu.be/2ximZEWL9a4?t=409)

[""Those plays put the QB in serious jeopardy and are a horrific loss of yardage""](https://youtu.be/2ximZEWL9a4?t=561)

I didn't make this to be a shit on James thread, but I think Gruden's 4th quarter playcalling was due to lack of trust in Andre's ability to cleanly snap in shotgun.

He decided to play conservative and punt, forcing Miami to need *two* 80-yard drives if they wanted to win or tie. Rather than risk a bad snap that could result in an uber-short field or defensive TD, or worse, an injury to Carr diving on a fumble amongst 300 pound linemen (remember Cam Newton's ""business decision""? DC wouldn't do that shit).

On the contrary, one could wonder why we didn't throw from behind-Center or even play action, especially on 1st down. Which is a good point that I don't have a rebuttal for.

I mean who cares though, the boys got the win and are 3-0. But it's Taco Tuesday‚Ñ¢ so let's talk about useless shit. Maybe it was just Gruden being Gruden. But maybe having a Center you don't trust has more implications on the gameplan than we'd like to admit. Theory: Lack of trust in Andre James is why Gruden went uber conservative in the 4th"

I'm a team fan living in South Korea. I'm traveling to LV Nov 11\~Nov 23, got the plane tickets and hotels and everything. Did not get football tickets yet, and I wish to go to both Chiefs game(11/14) and Bengals game(11/21). First time going to any sporting event in the States so I'm definitely clueless.

Few questions:  
1. I've checked out Stubhub and Seatgeek but I don't know exactly where to get tickets. I don't see any official ticket site, are official tickets all gone and only resale tickets left? Where I live ticket resale is actually illegal(kinda), and I'm not used to getting resales. How do I not get scammed?(how to find trustworthy sites/sellers or what i should be looking out for)

2. Due to team going 3-0 tickets prices seem to be on the high side($400+for chiefs game). Should I wait for the team to maybe lose a game for the price to drop? I've heard ticket prices drop near game day but since I'm getting on the plane and everything I don't want to risk not being able to get tickets too much.

3. Where to get jerseys, good food places, etc. Any generic advice will really help.

The whole right side of the Miami pass pro has been wiped right off the whiteboard. Ngakoue puts the cherry on top by bulling his man back and meeting the spin brothers at the QB. 

I'll also say that the DE's started the contest beating the OTs to the edge, and from there the move/countermove chess match was headed to a spin sack, but holy cow, this is just such a dominant moment.

49,pwnlq3,raiders,1632768259,1,38,12,780,"Before I provide my thoughts, I wanted to state 2 facts:

1. we've finished each game with 2 backups (vs BAL, vs MIA) or 3 (@ PIT) on the OL

2. zone blocking requires pairs of OL to engage in tandem blocks, with one OL peeling off to block a defender on the 2nd level (e.g. LB or SS). It requires OL to move in sync with each other

\#2 requires the same 5 guys playing with each other with real reps to get it dialed in.

OK, with that out of the way, here are the things that I've observed through 3 games from left-to-right:

1. **LT Miller has been mostly clean**, aside from a couple pre-snap penalties @ PIT and vs MIA.

2. **LG Simpson has been very Jekyll and Hyde**. Some games (e.g. vs BAL) he was serving up pancakes left and right, showing off his power and play strength. However against PIT's Heyward and again vs MIA, there were times where he was badly out-leveraged. He also missed a stunt vs MIA that got Carr nailed on that 1st sack yesterday

3. **C James continues to have issues with his snap placement**. I actually like the dead ball technique. Peyton Manning vastly prefers it. Some people dislike the speed it gets to the QB, but the QB has an easier time handling it and can watch the D while the ball is coming to him. It's not uncommon for C / QB to muff the exchange once ever few games. But we're seeing off-target snaps in every game. Carr is a good athlete and has covered for some off-target snaps, but we risk fumbles, sacks, and hits on Carr. TBH, I've never seen an NFL C struggle with snap placement as much as James has, and you know they've been practicing it. That has to improve. From a blocking perspective, he's not a powerhouse, but technically he's mostly fine

4. For a guy who joined the team after the initial roster was set, **RG Eluemunor has played solid**. His experience clearly shows. Eluemunor stepping in remind me of Good in 2019 and 2020. Eluemunor was a very solid get and a good reminder of why scouring the cuts after the initial rosters is so important

5. **RT Leatherwood has been up and down, but he's also faced some stellar pass rushers** vs BAL and especially @ PIT (TJ Watt). My initial impression from the MIA game is that it was his cleanest NFL game so far (aside from his tackling a DL as he was falling during that late 4Q big run by Barber, and we were lucky he didn't get flagged). The rough thing about the AFCW is that it's loaded with talented pass rushers who take most of their snaps as left edge rushers (Von Miller) or rotate there (Bosa). So Leatherwood has his work cut out for him. He's definitely better at run blocking than pass pro. Be patient team Nation, he'll get there

**As I said at the beginning, the OL needs time to gel, given that we employ a lot of zone looks in the run game**. Jacobs is a terrific zone runner, and Barber also showed the vision, decisiveness, and power needed for zone vs MIA. I think getting Jacobs back will meaningfully help, because he can do things like that stellar 15-yd TD run vs BAL.

So if the 5 we have playing now stay healthy, there is reason to believe they'll gradually get better.

**Carr has been simply magnificent**, and he's the 1st QB ever to have 4 guys with 200+ receiving yards in the 1st 3 games. Carr is making it work. He has made so many huge plays by climbing the pocket and buying enough time for routes to develop. And we are seeing the big jump from Ruggs and Edwards that we were hoping for. We are 3-0 with an OL that has struggled mightily with consistency"

69,pwjnsq,raiders,1632756997,1,31,12,395,"Watching the 2021 team offense has gotten me thinking about the pass distribution compared to previous years.

In 2018, the team hit WR's for 2,116 yards. Cooper was hurt. Bryant, Gruden's White Tiger, was a letdown. Jordy Nelson did what he could, but he was out of tread.  

In 2019, the team passed to WR's for roughly 1,858 yards. Barely 116 yards a game. They beat Saints WR Michael Thomas in season yards by just over 100 yards. Ouch. It was clear the team put a lot of eggs in the Mr. Big Chest basket, but that went bad. Fuck AB.

In 2020, WR receptions accounted for 2,351 yards. Or 146.93 yards  a game. Trending up. Agholor with the biggest team WR season in a few years. But the progress was temporary as Agholor took the money and ran to the train wreck in New England. Fuck Trent Brown. But....

I know it's early, but thus far in 2021, WR's have tallied 726 yards through the air. Or, 242 yards a game. I don't think it will stick (I can hope), but if this pace holds, our wideouts would be responsible for over 4,000 yards without factoring TE's or HB/FB.

Again, that won't happen. But you can't ignore it. The WR's are getting better and they are getting more involved. And, the main 3 of Renfrow, Ruggs and Edwards, these are guys they are developing. That's important to remember. The way they have stepped up is one of the reasons this team is 3-0. Just wanted to give a shout out to the WR's being a legitimate part of the offense. It's been trending this way, and it's nice to see it pay off so large through 3 games.

Our staff finally found a solution to a long-running problem. After seasons of searching for immediate fixes, they fixed it through the draft and development - which is quite the opposite from Gruden's positional track record at the WR position.

* This year our pass blocking AND run blocking have been atrocious and yet we are 1st in yards and 6th in points. You must understand how must pressure it puts on a playcaller when the lineman can't block well! You have to have so many different money plays and ways to compensate. 
* To those saying Gruden is too conservative, we rank 10th with 64% of our plays being pass plays.  Also, Gruden ranked 8th of all coaches in football outsiders aggressiveness index for 2020. 
* We are 7th in time of possession.

So I ran down the aisle to his row after the safety and let him know we're not doing that here lol. Buddy was distraught by halftime after the missed FG. The entire 4th quarter I was so nervous. Being team fans we know how these things go, so I was beyond stressed. Seeing the Dolphins fans walk out after that long run by Barber to set us up was so satisfying. After the luck we've had with them it was nice to come out with the win.

As for the stadium, it's amazing. I don't think there's a bad seat in there. I had already went for SummerSlam (couldn't wait to see the stadium) but seeing it on gameday was so much better. team chants everywhere you went, and everyone was in such high spirits it was dope. The food and drinks were so good, got a Modelo tall can before I even went into the stadium. Also, I got to check out the team Image there and it's huge. Picked up a jersey for when I go to my SECOND NFL game a week from today, hoping we get the win in LA. It'll be nice to see our second home.

I had a blast and wanna thank everyone for the kind words. Can't wait for the next one! Hope everyone gets a chance to visit. Go team! RN4L!!! [Update} I WENT To My First Game"

I am a 25 y/o lifelong fan. I‚Äôve known nothing but sorrow as a team fan. I superstitiously say I‚Äôm not superstitious. But this year, as part of my budget grocery shopping I‚Äôve found myself with Totino‚Äôs pizza (you can get full off of $1.50-$3, like holy crap that‚Äôs a deal) and jokingly during the first game I ate it at the beginning of the game, saying ‚Äúabusing my health to represent the team abusing my mental health‚Äù and they won, so I did it the next week, and they won. 

But this week I decided to convince myself it wasn‚Äôt the pizza. That me eating some cheap yet delectable cheesy goodness and carbs thousands of miles away from Vegas had 0 affect on how the team played. Oh how wrong I was. 

Down 14-0, I told my GF it was time to go, we went to Publix and right as I got back in my truck with two totinos pizzas, Hayward Jr. gets the safety. Coincidence? No. It‚Äôs the power of Totinos.

I get home, and put the square pizzas in the oven. We get a field goal. 

I pull them out, and begin eating one. I get the first one down, Ingold gets the 1 yard TD. The spirit of Totinos is literally lifting the team confidence. 

I eat the second one. My accountant Renfrow gets in the end zone the same way I get in a food coma. Totinos is in full affect. 

As the food sets heavy in my gut, Peyton (great name) Barber dives in the end zone.

In summary, I am eternally sorry and until we lose, I will continue my Totinos ritual. I would like to formally apologize to team Nation"

a) Gus Bradley knowing how to stop Justin Herbert because he played against Herbert offense in practice
b) Justin Herbert knowing how to pick us apart since he played against Bradley defense in practice Next week will be a very interesting game for Gus Bradley"
