Why do mods delete those types of posts here? Is that a rule or did something happen in the 2 bad years between Shanahan and Harbaugh? Why do mods delete every post that contains some criticism to Kyle?"
4,q0y6sg,49ers,1633321297,1,43,8,955,"I'm not trying to go on a rant or seem delusional (mods please don't delete this I wanna have a nice conversation :))))), I've been a huge Kyle fan and have defended him a lot, but his decision making and comments since the end of the 2020 season have been highly questionable in my opinion.

The 2020 revenge tour ended and it was clear that the team needed to move on fromJimmy and the strategy of bringing more or less the 2019 team wasn't gonna work, they needed a change. They flirted with almost every QB available (Teddy, Rodgers, Flacco, Stafford, even Darnold!) because they believed Jimmy wasn't gonna elevate this team. Only wait... all of a sudden they trade up to number 3 and decide to keep Jimmy. Why? At that point it seemed obvious what Jimmy was, a good QB who struggles to be consistent with his health and with critical points of his game, what was the reason to bring him back? 

The 2020 team finished the season 6-10, not a good record. What did the FO led by Kyle do to improve the team? Sign the same players that had gotten injured on the failed revenge tour (Tartt, Williams, Jones). How could anyone expect this team to improve when they bringed back the same injury prone players that had gotten them to a 6-10 season? Jimmy and this guys showed what they were on the year 2020 and the team made it clear that they weren't satisfied with Jimmy, but then they convinced themselves that this roster that went 6-10 was good enough to compete for a SB? What is different from this 2021 than the 2020 team? The players talked a lot about the 2019 team, and the ''2019 vibes'' this team was getting, what? 2019 was 2 years ago, this guys aren't the same, the league isn't the same. Why couldn't everyone just be humble and accept that 2019 is gone and move on? They are stuck in a limbo where they didn't build for the future bc Trey didn't get proper development (more on that in my next point) and they can't compete now bc this is the same team as 2020, except from Alex Mack and Samson Eboukam. Where's the improvement? We have no Saleh and no Verrett.

Then there's the Trey thing, he certainly has the highest ceiling out of any QB in the draft and his development will dictate if he was worth the trade up. But, does anyone else feel like Trey hasn't really improved since OTAs? His high misses and wobble are things that are there since his college days. A coach like Kyle who has been hailed as this ''QB whisperer'' who traded up to 3 for the future of the franchise shouldn't be displaying these results. We have seen what he's said on the media about Trey, if it was Harbaugh he would do everything he could to prop up his young QB, that's what you need to do, he's your franchise, he's the face of the team not Kyle. Has Kyle really put Trey's development above else? That's what he should've, somehow this team got proped up as a SB ready team along the way when we always've had the same issues as 2020, and the kid hasn't really been proper developed. Does Kyle really wanna coach Trey? After all of this I'm not so sure.

And then his personnel decisions, he won't play Trey bc he feels this is a SB ready roster (lol) and they need to win now. But then he hires a rookie DC to take over a ''SB caliber defense'', that seems questionable to me, even if DeMeco does end up being great it's weird he really didn't interview anyone outside of the organization. Then the one that seems most egregious to me, the QB coach. Honestly, Kyle's QB coaches have sucked. Scangarello never played QB in his life and Philadelphia didn't want him (a team with a young QB) and Day didn't do anything. From the QBs we've had over the years (Jimmy, Mullens, Beathard, now Trey) what have they improved in? I really can't name anything these QBs have improved, they have gotten arguably worse under Kyle. And if we're being honest, all Kyle has to show for QB development is Matt Ryan's MVP season, where Ryan was already an amazing QB before Kyle. I'm not so sure Kyle is that great with QBs and if he's the best option to coach this team. And he really gets defensive.

What do you think? I think Kyle is a great OC, but sadly I'm not sure he's a great HC.

Mods please don't delete this! I tried not to sound aggresive but English isn't my main language. I wanna hear opinions! Has Kyle Shanahan gotten too many excuses?"

6,q0xoch,49ers,1633319253,1,19,26,329,"Yes I‚Äôm bitter. Aren‚Äôt we all? I‚Äôm sick of all the hype each year and let down after let down. 2019 is the anomaly but yet we keep holding onto that as if that is the expected result under the Shanahan regime. 

May be an unpopular opinion but‚Ä¶..when do the excuses stop and Shanahan finally gets held accountable? Especially with this roster that was hyped up and down all preseason for its depth. The injuries continue to pile up like previous years (frankly I think this year could be worse than ‚Äò20) but get passed off as ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù, however, there comes a point where you have to look inward. Frankly, just win fucking games. It‚Äôs the NFL. It‚Äôs a grown man‚Äôs league and the strong survive. Shanahan and his staff have failed to make the adjustments and it‚Äôs very clear after 4 weeks. Barely escaped the lowly Lions, scraped by the Eagles, got clobbered in the first half to Packers and came back to make it exciting but couldn‚Äôt finish it off, and clobbered the Seahawks the first half on D but couldn‚Äôt capitalize on O. Pete Carroll and the Seahawks are Shanahan‚Äôs Daddy and he‚Äôs their bitch, plain and simple. Sick of Shanahan getting a pass each week and year when his record speaks for itself. He‚Äôs a scarred coach with 2 Super Bowl blunders that may be the defining moments of his coaching career. 

To all team Faithful, at what point is the Captain held accountable??

If Shanny doesn‚Äôt put together a playoff team this year or next, fire his ass. End. Of. Story. team‚Äô organization hyped this team so hard this season just so they could throw a nifty patch on gear and sell through that shit."
7,q0xfdv,49ers,1633318256,1,13,11,188,"Think back to November 11, 2012. Alex Smith is 7 of 8 with a touchdown. He was coming off a 19-20 performance in Arizona and was running the offense in a super-efficient way all year. He gets concussed. Kaep comes in. He goes an uninspiring 11-17 for 117 with a rushing TD. The team tie a vastly inferior Rams team. 

Then, Kaep gets a week to practice with the first team. He detonates on Chicago the following week. The rest is history that we all know very well. 

Point being: Trey looked as you‚Äôd expect for a rookie coming off the bench with no reps with the ones. When he gets practice reps and there‚Äôs a gameplan for him this week, it‚Äôs going to look a lot better. Not saying that means he‚Äôll wreck the Cardinals and we‚Äôll be headed to the Super Bowl, but if he keeps playing, this is going to look a lot better than today. For all of you panicking about Trey‚Äôs shaky start‚Ä¶"

Uber/Lyft seems to be a bad choice it's like $100 and probably more on the way back with surge pricing.  

Renting a car is only $130, but then I'd have to drive and I don't like driving where I don't know where anything is.  And we'd probably have to pay for parking.

77,pyq1fv,49ers,1633027243,1,28,10,539,"First of all, I'm a big Kyle fan. I believe he's an awesome play caller and a great football mind. But I believe his honeymoon phase with this fanbase and overall has ended and now we're in year 5 and we should question if he really is all that. Back in 2017 nobody wanted to be here, now in 2021 coaches would kill to be the HC of our team.

He hired a rookie DC coordinator (DeMeco) while not interviewing anyone outside the organization for the job. Hiring DeMeco isn't bad but it is ironic that he traded up all the way to 3 for a back-up QB that he won't play but gave a ''SB ready defense'' a rookie DC. I think that's contradictory.

In training camp he really never gave Trey a chance to take his job. He said: ''Coaches and players will know when Trey is better''. Which is true but then he went and called play and made Trey play like Jimmy instead of letting Trey be Trey. How would Trey show he's ready if you protect Jimmy's weaknesses and show Trey's?

''This is a win now team''. Then he went and drafted a back-up QB in round 1, a developmental guard in round 2, a RB with tons of talent in round 3 that looks worse than a 6 round QB and a healthy scratch CB in round 3. Instead of trading down and taking a no premiere position like guard we could've had Asante Samuel Jr instead of Aaron Banks, he certainly would've been an upgrade over Diontae Johnson.

QBs throughout the years. He didn't want to scout Patrick Mahomes because he wanted Kirk Cousins, nobody could've predicted Mahomes being Mahomes but really? Didn't scout him because you had your mind made? Good decision makers all always open to options, not as close minded as that. Then he didn't want to play Jimmy bc ''he wasn't ready'' (when have we heard that one) and Jimmy won 5 in a row. He didn't like Beathard, Mullens, Mahomes, Garoppolo, Fields, Brady. So what type of Qb does Kyle like? We have all heard about his decision to not sign Brady, that should be a fireable offense but alright. Then he has been frustraded with Jimmy since 2018 but then keeps him and doesn't draft anything to help him. I don't wanna seem delusional but all of this decisions really don't seem normal to me. Would like to hear opinions though!

I know Kyle doesn't make all the decisions, but his de main man in that building and everything he says goes. He has full control so he really is the one that mandates what's done in the team. And so far he's been really hit and miss. Is Kyle Shanahan indecisive and a bad decision maker?"

11,pxwvw4,49ers,1632926789,1,11,18,293,"Before the season began, I was really full of hope. We re-signed 4 of our 5 starting DB (Verrett, Moseley, Williams, Tartt), Ford and Bosa were healthy, signed Mack, and traded up to get a young explosive QB.

After a season with no starting QB, we finally had a real reason to have some serious expectation for the season. And Kyle's speech saying how he plans to have a two QB system, while weird, was exciting because it implied Lance could bring some of his explosiveness into the games, what Jimmy wasn't able to do.

But now, I feel like it might have not been the plan to begin with. That Kyle fully intended for Lance to have this year off to ""develop"" and go with Jimmy as a starter. That this year was just a stepping stone for Lance's first real season next year.

And now that 3 games have been played, it even feels like Shanahan doesn't care of how this season ends. He will call his plays to enable Jimmy to play a maximum of snaps while limiting his opportunities of making mistakes, even if that means calling 3 straight inside runs into loaded boxes in a close game.

Some of it might be influenced by the situation at CB or RB, but I must say that for the first time, I feel like Shanahan has very different expectations than fans for this season, and the quality of football on the game will be very disappointing. Am I the only one with that feeling ? Does anyone else feel like Kyle's plan for the season doesn't match the fans expectation ?"

Through three weeks, starter Jimmy Garoppolo's performance hasn't been very impressive. When the offense couldn't score from the goal line, coach Kyle Shanahan brought in Trey Lance, who immediately [got the job done](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/team/trey-lance-follows-trent-williams-massive-block-gutsy-team-td) without breaking a sweat.¬†

Garoppolo had two costly turnovers in the game and was rather inconsistent all night. That begs the question, when do the team make the switch to Lance?¬†

NBC Sports' Peter King joined 95.7 The Game's ""[Damon, Ratto &amp; Kolsky](https://go.audacy.com/2oMcEjB5Vjb)""¬†to discuss what he believes the team need from the quarterback position right now.¬†

‚ÄúThe other day when I was watching the game, I just said, ‚ÄòThey need to have a quarterback who‚Äôs going to challenge a secondary more,' "" King said. ""It‚Äôs hard to tell right now if Kyle Shanahan (just) doesn‚Äôt want to call plays that call for the quarterback to challenge outside the numbers.¬†

""When I'm watching the game, that bothers me. Garoppolo had a really really good drive at the end of the game. It‚Äôs clear that Jimmy Garoppolo is not afraid, he‚Äôs been battle-tested and all that. The question is, is his arm good enough to trust him consistently on throws like that. The way Kyle Shanahan called the game the other day, I would say no.""

Has there been enough film on Garoppolo through three weeks to say that the team should bench him? King believes San Francisco needs to wait just a little bit longer.¬†

""One of the things that we just simply don‚Äôt know yet because we haven‚Äôt seen enough is that we need to see two or three games more before we make any long-term judgments on the offense and on Garoppolo because I think you‚Äôre going to be able to tell.‚Äù

The team¬†likely are having consistent conversations about the quarterback position each and every week. At what point do those conversations get more serious?¬†

""At some point, you have to determine whether your quarterback is holding you back, and I think that is going to happen here in the next two or three weeks,"" King said. ""I think Jimmy Garoppolo -- and in no way am I saying (he‚Äôs playing for his job) because I don‚Äôt necessarily believe that -- but I do think that if Kyle Shanahan has to make a change, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to be afraid to do so.‚Äù

Garoppolo hasn't been terrible, but he hasn't been playing like a quarterback who came into training camp with an extra-large chip on his shoulder, ready to prove his doubters wrong. Garoppolo's job is probably safe for another week or two, but if the team continue to struggle on offense, a change might¬†come sooner than later.¬†

Jimmy Garoppolo has been OK through three games, which is clear from his standing right in the middle of the pack. The team have to be encouraged by the fact that he has only one interception but frustrated by some of the inconsistency and the team's penchant for slow starts over the past couple of games. Garoppolo still struggles to push the ball down the field; he has attempted just four passes traveling 20-plus yards in the air, completing one and throwing his lone pick on another.

56,px5lgd,49ers,1632833073,1,23,54,500,"SANTA CLARA ‚Äî Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo ranks 32nd in the NFL in number of deep passes attempted through two games of the 2021 season.

But team coach Kyle Shanahan is not complaining.

He said Garoppolo has done exactly as he has been coached.

‚ÄúI think Jimmy has played very well these last two games, and has gotten the ball exactly where it needs to be,‚Äù Shanahan said on team Game Plan, which airs Friday at approximately 9 p.m. PT on NBC Sports Bay Area.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had two as good of games in a row as he‚Äôs had.‚Äù

Garoppolo attempted just two passes of 20 yards or more down the field in the team‚Äô victories at Detroit and Philadelphia, according to Pro Football Focus.

One of those attempts resulted in a 79-yard touchdown pass to Deebo Samuel against the Lions. Garoppolo completed 39 of 55 pass attempts (70.9 percent) for 503 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions in two games.

Shanahan said Garoppolo has been perfect with his decision-making.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs missed one down-the-field throw,‚Äù Shanahan said. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of plays that go down the field, but there‚Äôs never a play that‚Äôs just called ‚ÄòThrow it down the field.‚Äô

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs going down the field; there‚Äôs usually a guy over the middle; and there‚Äôs usually a guy underneath. And (it‚Äôs) how is the defense playing it?‚Äù

Shanahan said the style of defense the Eagles played last week led the team to throw more underneath and screen passes.

Philadelphia played as deep in pass coverage as any defense Shanahan said he has ever seen.

‚ÄúI think Jimmy has been very aggressive, seeing it right, and making the right decisions,‚Äù Shanahan said.

In two games, Garoppolo targeted Samuel 20 times (15 catches for 182 yards) and tight end George Kittle nine times (eight receptions, 95 yards). Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk has seen just two passes go his way. He has one catch for 6 yards.

Like the depth of the passes, the intended receiver is also dictated by the coverage of the defense, Shanahan said.

‚ÄúEvery play has a guy who‚Äôs No. 1 in the progression,‚Äù Shanahan said. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre trying to call a play to get that person the ball when you get the exact right coverage and they beat that. That happens 50 percent of the time. And when it doesn‚Äôt happen, you go to No. 2.‚Äù

25,pwhji3,49ers,1632750777,3,9,38,169,"I'm not a team fan, but I think you all have a ton to look forward too.

Clearly, Jimmy G is starting because your team isn't a dumpster fire like the Jets and you want your best chance of winning games to be behind center.

However, once Trey Lance develops and can throw/game manage/run the play book as well as Jimmy, he should take your offense to an incredible next level.

The biggest problem with Jimmy is that he's a good (maybe even great?) when the game just needs to be managed. He can make every throw out of a clean pocket, and usually make the right reads. However, as soon as their is pressure, or the game plan falters, he might as well hold up a white flag.

Trey Lance is the eventual answer to this. Just wanted to spread some positivity after a tough loss. Shanahan/Garoppolo dynamic is a house of cards. As soon as things get off script it's a disaster. Trey Lance will EVENTUALLY bring so much more to the offense when game plans / plays derail."

Obviously they both heavily relied on their defense and a strong run game and yet...their careers will always be remembered for when they *strayed* from that formula. For Carroll it's the biggest blunder in Super Bowl history, I mean, how do you not run it there? And for Harbaugh it was insisting on having The Catch III, no doubt for good fodder on the post-retirement talking circuit. I mean to have back-to-back seasons end at the goal line by doing what you don't do best? Ride the horse that brought you.

In any case, anyone else wonder if it was a form of projection that fueled this animosity and, in doing, gave both cover - as they could safely feel distanced - leading to them never resolving this inadequacy in themselves and, dare I say, thus becoming the very obstacle that stood in their way? In other words, they're their own worst enemy cause they're on in the same. What's your deal? Harbaugh = Carroll?"
